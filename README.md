# Networks Sciences (MO412 / MC908) - Assignment 10

## Network Flow

Consider the flow network given by the attached file [links.csv](links.csv) containing lines of the form `u,v,c` meaning that the capacity of edge `(u,v)` is `c`. No other nodes exist in the graph except the ones present in some line of the links file. You job is to compute the value of a maximum flow in this flow network from `s` to `t`, where `s` is the node corresponding to your name's two initial letters, and `t` is the node corresponding to your group partner name's two initial letters. If your group has three members, you can choose any of the other two members to be your sink node. The source must still be your node.

Instead of doing the max flow calculation by hand or writing your own code to do it, we recommend that you use some already tested implementation from the internet, e.g., networkx has a few implementations you can use.

Please submit your code (can be a Jupyter notebook) together with your answer (max flow) in Assignment 10.  I forgot to ask in the instructions.

## [Turn in](maxflow.py)

```bash
$ python3 maxflow.py
Maximum Flow from Ti to Iu: 3
```
